# CSS Grids Photo Wall Practice

- Pictures from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/).

- To Do:

  - [] Add event listeners to `index.js` file.
        - Hover effect (add shadow or increase size) for photos based on mouseover.
        - Onclick to play a familiar tune.
  - [] Add Mocha tests for js functions.
  - [] Continue adding more details for each photo, within each grid `div`.
